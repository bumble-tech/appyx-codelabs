# Create a Simple App with Appyx

## Before you start
Points to cover here:
* Clone codelab repo
* Explain project structure
    * Project structure app + solution
    * Initial status(starter kit)

## Goal
Points to cover here:
* What are we going to cover/ what is the codelab about
* What are we going to implement

## Functionality description

## 1. Defining our new base structure
create new folder for log-out log-in
Move Child1 to loggedin
Rename Child1 to LoggedInNode
Move Child1 to loggedout
Rename Child1 to LoggedOutNode

## 2. Clean up nodes
Root:
* Rename configuration: Child1 -> LoggedOut and Child2 -> LoggedIn
* Remove unrequired code: initAnimation and init block
LoggedOutNode:
* Change button text to "Log In"
* Change text to "This is LoggedOutNode"
LoggedInNode:
* Change text to "This is LoggedIntNode"


## 3. Modifying history navigation
* If you install the app right now, the expected behaviour would be:
 * Root node is created and loggedOut configuration is set(as it is the default). 
 * If you click the button, LoggeIn is created
 * If you press back, previous node is shown.
So at this point, we have a super simple case where by clicking on the button you are simulating the logging action. However, pressing back you are navigating to the previous screen, that's not what we are looking for, as it would represent that we are logging out the user when pressing back, so let's change that:

To do so, open rootNode and let's change the push operation in "swapChildren" for "replace". You can also remove the if block and the pop. By doing so, when calling swapChildren we are removing loggedout from the history and add logged in. So if you compile now, you should not "logged out"(go the previous node) when clicking back.

[Insert gif of the app navigation state at this point]

 That's better! Now we don't "logged out" the user when we click back, however this kind of navigation is not realistic, we want to navigate the app base on some loggin status and not just replace the nodes when clicking a button. So let's do this.

## 4. Creating the state
Create some interface to log in, log out, and expose state.
We can do a simple implementation with SharedPreferences

## 5. Control root navigation based on state
change root node so navigation is controlled based on state
add log out button

## 6. Improving the logged-out state ui
* Make LoggedOutNode to extend parent node
* Create configurations: User & Password (just input field)
* Update UI: Title, box with Children inside  and "Next/Log In" button
* Dummy nodes for both states

## 7. Creating LoggedOut children
* Create the actual nodes
* Replace the dummies
* add navigation -> state based or callback based for this? -> Let's keep it simple!
Let's improve logged-in ui!

## 8. Improving the logged-in state ui
* Make LoggedInNode to extend parent node
* Update UI: Title, box with Children inside
* Create configurations: Summary(Box with textView "You are logged as $Username") and LogOut(Just a log out button)
* Dummy nodes for both states

## 9. Creating LoggedIn children
* Create the actual nodes
* Replace the dummies
* add navigation -> state based or callback based for this? -> Let's keep it simple!
* add animation
